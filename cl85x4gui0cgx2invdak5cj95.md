NoSQL databases have been on the rise in recent years, as they offer benefits over traditional relational databases. However, a new type of database called SurrealDB is now being developed that promises to provide even more benefits. In this article, we'll take a look at SurrealDB and how it could change the database landscape in the years to come.

## What is SurrealDB?

SurrealDB is a new type of database that uses artificial intelligence to automatically manage data. SurrealDB is designed to be scalable and easy to use, with the goal of making it the go-to database for businesses of all sizes.

## The Different Types of Databases

There are a few different types of databases out there. The most popular type is the relational database, which is what most people think of when they hear the word “database”. Relational databases store data in tables, and you can use SQL to query them.

Another popular type of database is the NoSQL database. These databases don’t use SQL, and they often store data in a more flexible way than relational databases. Many NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable, which means they can handle more traffic by adding more servers.

There are also NewSQL databases, which are a mix of relational and NoSQL databases. They use SQL but often have some of the same features as NoSQL databases.

Finally, there are graph databases, which are designed to store data that is connected in a graph structure. These are often used for social media applications or other applications where data is interconnected.

## Why it's NewSQL

We've all heard of traditional databases like MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. They've been around for decades, and they're tried and true. But there's a new era of databases on the horizon, and it's called NewSQL.

NewSQL databases are designed to meet the needs of modern applications that require high performance and scalability. They're also able to handle the increasing volume and complexity of data that businesses are dealing with today.

There are a number of reasons why NewSQL is gaining popularity. First, traditional databases are not able to keep up with the performance demands of modern applications. Second, NewSQL databases are much easier to scale than their traditional counterparts. And finally, NewSQL databases offer a number of features that traditional databases do not, such as horizontal scaling, sharding, and real-time analytics.

If you're looking for a database that can meet the needs of your modern application, then NewSQL is definitely worth considering.

## Pros and Cons of SurrealDB

SurrealDB is a new kind of database that promises to revolutionize the way we interact with data. But like all new technologies, it comes with both benefits and risks. In this blog post, we'll explore the pros and cons of SurrealDB to help you decide if it's right for your needs.

Pros:

1. Increased flexibility: SurrealDB allows you to easily store and query data of any type, without having to predefine a schema. This makes it ideal for applications that need to deal with unstructured or rapidly changing data.

2. Improved performance: SurrealDB's use of sharding and replication techniques can improve performance by distributing the load across multiple machines.

3. Easy scalability: Since SurrealDB is designed to run on a cluster of commodity servers, it's easy to scale up as your needs grow.

Cons:

1. Immature technology: SurrealDB is still a relatively new technology, and as such, it may be subject to potential security vulnerabilities or other bugs.

2. Requires specialized skills: Because SurrealDB is so different from traditional relational databases, you'll need specialized skills and knowledge to work with it effectively

What are the use cases of SurrealDB?

SurrealDB can be used for a variety of purposes, including data warehousing, real-time analytics, and general-purpose database management.

## How to get started with SurrealDB?

If you're looking for a new database to try out, why not give SurrealDB a shot? It's a powerful database that's been gaining popularity lately, and it's definitely worth checking out. Here's how to get started:

1. Download SurrealDB from its website.

2. Install it on your computer following the instructions provided.

3. Start using SurrealDB! You can use it just like any other database, but be sure to read the documentation first so that you know how to take advantage of its unique features.

## Conclusion
I think SurrealDB is great and has the potential to do great in the future as well. I am looking forward to using it in my next project, learning more about it, and writing more articles about it.
