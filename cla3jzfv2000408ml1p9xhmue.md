Cyber Security is a fascinating field of computer science that is growing more important every day. As our lives become increasingly dependent on technology, the need for people who can protect our data and systems from attack becomes more urgent. In this article, we will learn how to get into Cyber Security and what to expect from a career in this exciting and rapidly-growing field.

## What is Cyber Security?

Cyber Security is a fascinating field of computer science that is growing in importance every day. As our lives become increasingly dependent on technology the need for people who can protect our data and systems from attack becomes more urgent.

## Why learn Cyber Security?

Benefits of Cyber Security:

1-Protect our lives

Protecting lives is the main reason why people wish to learn Cyber Security. If you are in a position to protect lives, that is the best reason to get into this field. You can use your passion for technology and computer science to help you to protect lives by reducing the risk of cyber attacks on healthcare and business systems and devices.

2-Keep yourself busy

As more and more people become dependent on technology, there is going to be a shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals. By teaching others about cyber security, you will be able to assist in recruiting these professionals. For right now, you can build up your expertise in this field and it will help you to stay well ahead of other people in this exciting field.

3- Develop Cyber Security skills

As technology becomes more advanced, you will be required to have additional skills to do your job. This is where Cyber Security training comes in. When you study Cyber Security, you will gain more and more skills that will help you to continue your career as a cybersecurity professional. You can use your cyber security skills to help to protect computers from cyber attacks and you can offer cyber Security training so your friends and colleagues can have more Cyber Security skills too.

## Resources

 As an espoused technology, cyber security starts simply with the basics: learning about the internet, starting with building IP address blocks (192.168.101.100) so you can begin by establishing open lines of communication on the amateur level.

After you have established that the Internet works, you can move on to establishing computer terminals by learning TCP/IP and email basics. Although, you will need to establish security protocols for your email network before using it.

After this, you can conclude by learning to secure your computer, looking into web servers and data, exploring virtual networks, establishing a web security setup, and finally Kazaa.

Once you have fixed all these needs, you can start to cross-compiling your knowledge by continuing to secure your computer, looking into file servers, knowing packet protocol protocols, establishing a file server, securing your router, finding vulnerable websites, and defending against malware.

Once you have concluded this amity, you are ready one step deeper and start combining information by learning DHCP and firewall, port forwarding, adding layer 1 and 2 security interceptors, looking into IPS and firewalls, and multiple other years.

With all that knowledge, you have basically developed a raw body of Cyber Security knowledge.

Until you work for any reputable security agency, make sure you are incorporated into multiple departments so that you have plenty of experience.

## Hands-on Practice with CTF

Capturing the Flag (CTF) by fighting level after level of challenging puzzles is the best way to learn. You should learn while you are young, so you won't forget how to solve puzzles the moment something gets too complicated. 

Aside from being a fun, addictive treadmill for your mind, it's a fantastic training ground for getting a job in cybersecurity, as companies across the world are looking for cybersecurity experts right now. 

picoCTF is a good CTF framework to start with. It contains many amazing Cyber Security challenges to go with like Web Exploitation, Reverse Engineering, Forensics, and more...

I also have a list of Writeups for picoCTF challenges, so beginners can get started right away!

## Conclusion

Cyber Security is a brand-new area of computer science. It is an interdisciplinary field that involves cybersecurity experts from many computer science specialties such as information security engineering, software engineering, cyber forensics, forensics, network engineering, decision sciences, digital forensics, forensics, video surveillance, mobile apps, computer programming, and many more. As the industry rapidly grows, there is a constant need for professionals who are well-trained in the defense and prevention of cyber attacks. 

Cyber security is one of the most important issues of our time. With so much of our lives moving online, it's more important than ever to make sure that our information is safe and secure.

In this article, we'll introduce you to the basics of cyber security. We'll discuss what cyber security is, why it's important, and how you can protect yourself online.

What Is Cyber Security?

Cyber security is the practice of protecting your computer systems from unauthorized access or damage. This includes protecting your data, your devices, and your networks from hackers and other cyber threats.

Why Is Cyber Security Important?

As more and more of our lives move online, the need for strong cyber security becomes increasingly important. Cybercrime costs the global economy billions of dollars every year, and that number is only going to continue to grow.
