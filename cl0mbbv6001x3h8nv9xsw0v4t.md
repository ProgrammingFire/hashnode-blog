title: "Deploy .NET Minimal APIs To Kubernetes!"
seoDescription: "Kubernetes provides an easy way to scale your application, compared to virtual machines. It keeps code operational and speeds up the delivery process."

## Prerequisites

- .NET 6 SDK Has To Be Installed Locally To Start Developing The Server.
- Docker Should Be Installed. If You Are Using Windows Or Mac Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) To Get More Tools
- A Kubernetes Cluster Should Be Running On Cloud Or Local. If You Are Running Kubernetes On Local Computer Install [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)

To check docker engine is working fine, run docker ps (If an error occurred docker is not running)

Kubectl version (If it shows both the client and server version youâ€™re good to go)

## Building The .NET Minimal API

The First Thing We Need To Do Is To Create A Solution File By Running This Command: 
```bash
# Create A Blank Directory And Enter It
mkdir MinimalApi
cd MinimalApi

# Create A New Solution File
dotnet new sln
```

Now We Need To Create A New Minimal Web Api Project And Add That To Our Solution:
```bash
# Create A New Minimal Web Api Project
dotnet new web -o MinimalApi

# Add That To Our Solution
dotnet sln add MinimalApi
```

Now Our Project Is Done We Can Test It Now: 
```bash
# Run The MinimalApi Project
dotnet run --project MinimalApi
```

Now Navigate To [http://localhost:5160](http://localhost:5160) To See Your "Hello World" Minimal API

## Containerizing The Application With Docker

Because Kubernetes Is A Container Orchestration System. We Can Use Docker To Build These Containers

For That, We Need To Create A File Called `Dockerfile` That Should Define The Steps Needed To Run Our Application On the Production

```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["MinimalApi/MinimalApi.csproj", "MinimalApi/"]
RUN dotnet restore "MinimalApi/MinimalApi.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/MinimalApi"
RUN dotnet build "MinimalApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "MinimalApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MinimalApi.dll"]
```

### Run The Container Locally

```bash
# Build The Docker Image
docker build -t programmingfire/minimal-api:1.0.0 # Replace programmingfire With Your Username

# Run The Container With That Image
docker run -d -p 80:8000 --name minimal-api programmingfire/minimal-api:1.0.0
```

Now Navigate To [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) To See Your "Hello World" Minimal API

### Push The Container To Docker Hub

Create an Account On Docker Hub And Login With That Account With The Following Command

```bash
docker login
```

Now We Are Ready To Push This Image To Docker Hub

```bash
docker push programmingfire/minimal-api:1.0.0
```

## Deploy To Kubernetes

Create A Folder Called `Kubernetes` Inside Of The `MinimalApi` Folder

Inside Of `Kubernetes` Folder Create A File `Deployment.yml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: minimal-api-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: minimal-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: minimal-api
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: minimal-api
          image: programmingfire/minimal-api:1.0.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          imagePullPolicy: Always
```

### Create A Kubernetes Service

Inside Of `Kubernetes` Folder Create A File `LoadBalancer.yml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: minimal-api-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: minimal-api
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

### Apply Both Deployment And Service
```bash
# Apply Kubernetes Deployment
kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/Deployment.yml

# Apply Kubernetes Service
kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/LoadBalancer.yml
```

Now After Some Time When All The Kubernetes Pods Are Created And Up And Running You Can Test Your Application On [http://localhost](http://localhost) Again

Just For Fun Let's Kill One Of The Pod In Kubernetes And See How Much Fast Is Kubernetes To Recover That

```bash
# List All The Pods
kubectl get pods

# Copy The ID Of Any Pod
kubectl delete pod <pod-id-here>
```

Now One Of 3 Pods Is Deleted

```bash
# List All The Pods Again
kubectl get pods 
```

All 3 Out Of 3 Pods Should Be Running Because Kubernetes ReCreated That Container When One Pod Get Deleted
