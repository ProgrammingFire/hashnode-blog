## Introduction

Docker has revolutionized the way we build, ship, and run applications by providing lightweight, isolated containers that encapsulate our applications and their dependencies. While Docker containers are widely used, many developers are curious about what goes on inside a container and how it works. In this article, we'll take a deep dive into Docker containers and explore what's inside them.

## Understanding Container Layers

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1689595414805/9d7308da-ff03-48a0-a461-e2bbb5e24ad3.png align="center")

At the core of Docker's containerization technology is the concept of layers. Docker containers are built using a layered file system, where each layer represents a change or modification to the file system. These layers are combined to form the final container image.

When you build a Docker image, each instruction in the Dockerfile adds a new layer to the image. For example, let's take a look at a sample Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile

# Base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 \
    python3-pip

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY . .

# Expose a port
EXPOSE 8080

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

In this example, each instruction (e.g., `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, etc.) adds a new layer to the image. Layers are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. This immutability allows Docker to optimize disk usage and improves performance by reusing layers across different images.

## The Container File System

The container file system is composed of the layers that make up the container image. When you start a container, a read-write layer called the container layer is added on top of the image layers. This container layer allows the container to modify the file system without affecting the underlying image.

The container file system is isolated from the host system and other containers. It provides a sandboxed environment where the application can run without interfering with other processes or files on the host system. This isolation ensures that the application inside the container has its isolated environment with its own dependencies, libraries, and configurations.

## Container Runtimes and Processes

Docker containers use a container runtime to manage the execution of containers. The container runtime is responsible for starting and stopping containers, managing the container file system, and providing the necessary isolation.

Under the hood, Docker leverages container runtimes like Docker Engine, containers, or other runtimes that adhere to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specifications. These runtimes provide the necessary tools and APIs to manage containers and their life cycles.

Each container runs as a separate process inside the host operating system. The container runtime creates an isolated environment for the container process, including its own network stack, process tree, and file system view. From the perspective of the host system, each container appears as an isolated process with its namespace.

## Container Networking

Container networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world. Docker provides a built-in networking solution that enables containers to connect to external networks. By default, containers are connected to a bridge network that allows them to communicate with each other using IP addresses.

Additionally, Docker allows you to create custom networks, such as overlay networks or user-defined bridge networks, to isolate and control the communication between containers.

## Container Security

Security is a critical aspect of containerization. Docker provides several security features to ensure the isolation and integrity of containers.

One of the key security features is container isolation. Containers use Linux namespaces and control groups (cgroups) to provide process isolation and resource constraints. Namespaces separate the container's view of the operating system resources, such as the process tree, network stack, and file system, from the host system and other containers. Cgroups, on the other hand, enforce resource limitations and prevent containers from consuming excessive resources.

Docker also offers the ability to apply security profiles and policies to containers using features like AppArmor or seccomp. These security profiles help restrict the actions and capabilities of the container, providing an additional layer of defense.

## Conclusion

Docker containers provide a powerful and efficient way to package, distribute, and run applications. By understanding what goes on inside a Docker container, you can better utilize Docker's capabilities and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

In this article, we explored the concept of container layers and the container file system. We discussed container runtimes and how they manage the execution of containers. We also looked at container networking and security, which are crucial aspects of containerization.

By diving into the internals of Docker containers, you gain a deeper understanding of how they work and how to optimize their usage. Armed with this knowledge, you can harness the full potential of Docker to build and deploy applications more effectively.

So next time you work with Docker containers, remember that they are composed of layered file systems, run with the help of container runtimes, have their isolated file systems and networking, and benefit from various security mechanisms. Docker containers are a powerful tool in modern software development and deployment, and understanding what's inside them empowers you to make the most of this technology.
