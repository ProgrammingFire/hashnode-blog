Programming Languages, The first thing that comes to a beginner's mind, Which programming language I should learn? Is it JavaScript? Is it TypeScript? Is it Rust? If he even picks a language then other questions come to his mind like Is it in demand? Is it popular? What can I do with it? Today, I'll answer all your questions about programming languages in this article.

## 1 - C#/.NET
Now, most people expect Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript to be here, but, let me tell you C# is the **best programming language to learn at first** because it covers all of the programming concepts you need to learn like it's an Object-Oriented language like Java, it's an Interpreted language like Python, it's also a compiled language like C, it can also run on web browser using WebAssembly like Rust. Another thing is that is built on top of the .NET Platform, which means that it can be used to build any sort of application like Web apps, Mobile apps, Backend servers, Serverless backends, Cloud functions, ML models, IoT apps, and more... and after that, if you still want to switch language, you already know a lot of programming concepts, so it's not that hard to learn another language after learning C#.

### Hello, World!
- Download and Install .NET from https://get.dot.net
-  Create a new project using
```bash
dotnet new console -o MyApp
```
- Write this program in `Program.cs`
```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```
- Run the program using
```bash
dotnet run
```

## 2 - TypeScript
Now, coming to web development you should learn TypeScript, and stick to it, it's the best programming language for web dev, whether that's backend or frontend, it's the best language to learn if you only want to be in the field of web development. With a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, it makes web development even easier. Also, it's built upon JavaScript so every JavaScript feature will apply here as well, Another thing is that TypeScript/JavaScript is very popular, so you'll get so many resources and tutorials for it.

### Hello, World!
- Download and Install Node.JS from https://nodejs.org
- Install the TypeScript compiler using `npm`
```bash
npm install tsc
```
- Create a new project using
```bash
mkdir MyApp
npm init
```
- Write this program in `main.ts`
```ts
console.log("Hello, World!")
```
- Run the program using
```bash
tsc main.ts
node main.js
```

## 3 - Python
Just like C#, you can do many things with Python, but I'll recommend Python for Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or Machine Learning. With a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for AI/DS/ML, it's the best programming for ML/AI/DS. But with frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI it's also a very good language for web development.

mkdir MyApp
echo "" > main.py
```
- Write this program in `main.py`
```py
print("Hello, World!")
```
- Run the program using
```bash
python main.py
```

## 4 - Dart/Flutter
When comes to mobile development, literally the best of all programming languages is Dart with the Flutter framework, the thing with Dart is that it's new so, that's why it solves a lot of problems that are in other programming languages which makes it very stable, and Dart code looks amazing!

```
- Write this program in `myapp.dart`
```dart
void main() {
    print('Hello, World!');
}
```
- Run the program using
```bash
dart run
```

## 5 - C++
Last but not the least, We got C++ for low-level programming, believe it or not still in 2022, C++ is a great programming language to learn to do low-level development, like building a driver for some hardware or just building a system that tends to be so fast like a machine learning engine. So many projects still use C++ and they cannot see another programming language replacing C++, one of those projects is Tensorflow which is a library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Overall if you want to build a low-level system or a software that tends to be fast then learn and use C++.

### Hello, World!
- Download and Install a C++ Compiler like Clang from https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html
- Create a new project using
```bash
mkdir MyApp
echo "" > Main.cpp
```
- Write this program in `Main.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World" << endl;
}
```
- Run the program using (clang)
```bash
clang Main.cpp -o Main
./Main
```
