## What is Tour Of Heroes?
_“The Tour of Heroes application that you build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The application has many of the features you'd expect to find in any data-driven application. The finished application acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.“_
