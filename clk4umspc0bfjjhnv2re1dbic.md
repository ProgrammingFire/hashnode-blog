## Introduction

Building a high-performance backend is crucial for modern web applications, where speed, scalability, and reliability are essential. Rust, a systems programming language known for its safety, concurrency, and performance, is an excellent choice for creating such backends. When combined with the Rocket web framework, Rust becomes a powerful tool for building blazing-fast APIs. In this article, we'll explore how to create a fast backend using Rust and Rocket, and we'll go a step further by implementing a CRUD API.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Rust: Install Rust by following the instructions on the official website ([https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).
    
2. Cargo: Cargo is Rust's package manager and builds system, and it comes bundled with the Rust installation.
    

## Step 1: Set Up a New Rust Project

To get started, open your terminal or command prompt and create a new Rust project using Cargo. Run the following command:

```bash
cargo new my-backend
```

This command creates a new directory named `my-backend` with the necessary project structure and files.

Navigate into the newly created project directory:

```bash
cd my-backend
```

## Step 2: Add Rocket as a Dependency

To use Rocket in our project, we need to add it as a dependency. Open the `Cargo.toml` file in your favorite text editor and add the following line under the `[dependencies]` section:

```bash
rocket = "0.5.0-rc.3"
```

Save the file and exit the editor. This configures our project to use the latest release candidate version of Rocket.

## Step 3: Create a Basic Rocket Application

Next, let's create a basic Rocket application. Open the `src/main.rs` file and replace its contents with the following code:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

use rocket::{serde::json::Json, State};
use rocket::fairing::AdHoc;
use rocket::tokio::sync::RwLock;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Todo {
    id: u64,
    title: String,
    completed: bool,
}

#[derive(Default)]
struct AppState {
    todos: RwLock<Vec<Todo>>,
}

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    let app_state = AppState::default();
    rocket::build()
        .attach(AdHoc::on_ignite("Todo API", |rocket| {
            Ok(rocket.manage(app_state))
        }))
        .mount("/", routes![index])
}
```

In this code, we define a basic Todo struct to represent our data model. We also define an `AppState` struct to manage the shared state of our application, which includes a `todos` vector wrapped in a read-write lock. Then we create a simple `index` route and add that to the `routes`.

### Get Todos

```rust
#[get("/todos")]
fn get_todos(state: &State<AppState>) -> Json<Vec<Todo>> {
    let todos = state.todos.read().expect("Failed to read todos lock");
    Json(todos.clone())
}
```

The `get_todos` function is a route handler that handles GET requests to the `/todos` endpoint. It reads the todos vector from the shared state and returns a JSON response containing the todos.

### Create Todo

```rust
#[post("/todos", data = "<todo>")]
fn create_todo(state: &State<AppState>, todo: Json<Todo>) -> Json<Todo> {
    let mut todos = state.todos.write().expect("Failed to acquire todos lock");
    let new_todo = todo.into_inner();
    todos.push(new_todo.clone());
    Json(new_todo)
}
```

The `create_todo` function is a route handler that handles POST requests to the `/todos` endpoint. It receives a JSON payload representing a new todo, adds it to the todos vector in the shared state, and returns the newly created todo as a JSON response.

### Update Todo

```rust
#[put("/todos/<id>", data = "<todo>")]
fn update_todo(state: &State<AppState>, id: u64, todo: Json<Todo>) -> Option<Json<Todo>> {
    let mut todos = state.todos.write().expect("Failed to acquire todos lock");
    for t in todos.iter_mut() {
        if t.id == id {
            *t = todo.into_inner();
            return Some(Json(t.clone()));
        }
    }
    None
}
```

The `update_todo` function is a route handler that handles PUT requests to the `/todos/<id>` endpoint. It receives a JSON payload representing an updated todo and searches for the todo with the provided id in the `todos` vector. If found, it updates the todo and returns it as a JSON response. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

### Delete Todo

```rust
#[delete("/todos/<id>")]
fn delete_todo(state: &State<AppState>, id: u64) -> Option<Json<Todo>> {
    let mut todos = state.todos.write().expect("Failed to acquire todos lock");
    let pos = todos.iter().position(|t| t.id == id)?;
    Some(Json(todos.remove(pos)))
}
```

The `delete_todo` function is a route handler that handles DELETE requests to the `/todos/<id>` endpoint. It searches for the todo with the provided id in the todos vector and removes it. If found, it returns the deleted todo as a JSON response. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

### Mount the Routes

Now we can mount these CRUD functions to the Routes like this:

```rust
rocket::build()
        .attach(AdHoc::on_ignite("Todo API", |rocket| {
            Ok(rocket.manage(app_state))
        }))
        .mount("/", routes![get_todos, create_todo, update_todo, delete_todo, index])
```

### Final App

The final `src/main.rs` looks like this:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

use rocket::{serde::json::Json, State};
use rocket::fairing::AdHoc;
use rocket::tokio::sync::RwLock;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Todo {
    id: u64,
    title: String,
    completed: bool,
}

#[derive(Default)]
struct AppState {
    todos: RwLock<Vec<Todo>>,
}

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[get("/todos")]
fn get_todos(state: &State<AppState>) -> Json<Vec<Todo>> {
    let todos = state.todos.read().expect("Failed to read todos lock");
    Json(todos.clone())
}

#[post("/todos", data = "<todo>")]
fn create_todo(state: &State<AppState>, todo: Json<Todo>) -> Json<Todo> {
    let mut todos = state.todos.write().expect("Failed to acquire todos lock");
    let new_todo = todo.into_inner();
    todos.push(new_todo.clone());
    Json(new_todo)
}

#[put("/todos/<id>", data = "<todo>")]
fn update_todo(state: &State<AppState>, id: u64, todo: Json<Todo>) -> Option<Json<Todo>> {
    let mut todos = state.todos.write().expect("Failed to acquire todos lock");
    for t in todos.iter_mut() {
        if t.id == id {
            *t = todo.into_inner();
            return Some(Json(t.clone()));
        }
    }
    None
}

#[delete("/todos/<id>")]
fn delete_todo(state: &State<AppState>, id: u64) -> Option<Json<Todo>> {
    let mut todos = state.todos.write().expect("Failed to acquire todos lock");
    let pos = todos.iter().position(|t| t.id == id)?;
    Some(Json(todos.remove(pos)))
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    let app_state = AppState::default();
    rocket::build()
        .attach(AdHoc::on_ignite("Todo API", |rocket| {
            Ok(rocket.manage(app_state))
        }))
        .mount("/", routes![get_todos, create_todo, update_todo, delete_todo])
}
```

## Step 4: Build and Run the Backend

Now, let's build and run our backend server. In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

Cargo will compile the project and start the Rocket server. You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
ðŸš€ Rocket has launched from http://localhost:8000
```

Congratulations! Your Rocket server is now running.

## Step 5: Test the CRUD API

To test our CRUD API, we can use cURL or any API testing tool like Postman. Here are some example API requests you can try:

1. **Create a Todo**:
    

* ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "title": "Buy groceries", "completed": false}' http://localhost:8000/todos
    ```
    
* **Get All Todos**:
    
* ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/todos
    ```
    
* **Update a Todo**:
    
* ```bash
    curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "title": "Buy groceries", "completed": true}' http://localhost:8000/todos/1
    ```
    
* **Delete a Todo**:
    

1. ```bash
    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/todos/1
    ```
    

Feel free to explore the API further and add more endpoints and functionalities as per your requirements.
