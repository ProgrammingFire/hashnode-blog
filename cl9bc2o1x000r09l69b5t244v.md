# picoCTF 2022: Reverse Engineering: file-run-2

## Introduction
**Challenge:** [file-run-2](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/267)

**Category:** Reverse Engineering

**Description:**

A program has been provided to you, what happens if you try to run it on the command line? Download the program [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/352/run).

## Solution

We have been provided with a file called `run`. If you try to run the file like this:
```bash
./run
```
It won't work as expected. You should first give yourself permission to execute this file.
```bash
chmod +x ./run
```
Now if you try to run this, it will ask you for an argument. So let's pass the given argument, "Hello!"
```bash
./run Hello!
picoCTF{F1r57_4rgum3n7_96f2195f}
```

## Conclusion
This one is what I think is one of the easiest challenges after [file-run-1](/picoctf-2022-reverse-engineering-file-run-1) ever on the picoCTF 2022.
