## Prerequisites

- NodeJS Has To Be Installed Locally To Start Developing The Server.
- Docker Should Be Installed. If You Are Using Windows Or Mac Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) To Get More Tools
- A Kubernetes Cluster Should Be Running On Cloud Or Local. If You Are Running Kubernetes On Local Computer Install [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)

To check docker engine is working fine, run docker ps (If an error occurred docker is not running)

Kubectl version (If it shows both the client and server version youâ€™re good to go)

## Building The Node Application

You Can Freely Use Your Own Application Here But I Am Going To Clone A Starter Repo From GitHub Which Uses TypeScript, Node.JS, Express For The Tech Stack

```bash
git clone https://github.com/programmingfire/node-express-typescript-starter.git
```

When The Repo Is Cloned Go-Ahead Run The Following Commands To Build And Start The Application

```bash
# Installs All The Dependencies
npm install

# Compiles The TypeScript Code
npm run build

# Start The Application
npm run start
```

Now Open Your Browser And Navigate To [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) And You Should See Hello World From The Server Also Go To [http://localhost:4000/api](http://localhost:4000/api) To See The Response In JSON

Now Our Application Is Successfully Running

## Containerizing The Application With Docker

Because Kubernetes Is A Container Orchestration System. We Can Use Docker To Build These Containers

For That, We Need To Create A File Called `Dockerfile` That Should Define The Steps Needed To Run Our Application On the Production

%[https://gist.github.com/programmingfire/c8beb43d579d202b9586b29e0edf3430]

## Run The Container Locally

```bash
# Build The Docker Image
docker build -t programmingfire/node-app:1.0.0 # Replace programmingfire With Your Username

# Run The Container With That Image
docker run -d -p 4000:8000 --name node-app programmingfire/node-app:1.0.0
```

Now Open Your Browser And Navigate To [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) And You Should See Hello World From The Server Also Go To [http://localhost:4000/api](http://localhost:4000/api) To See The Response In JSON

### Push The Container To Docker Hub

Create an Account On Docker Hub And Login With That Account With The Following Command

```bash
docker login
```

Now We Are Ready To Push This Image To Docker Hub

```bash
docker push programmingfire/node-app:1.0.0
```

## Deploy To Kubernetes

Create A Folder Called `k8s`

### Create A Kubernetes Deployment

Inside Of `k8s` Folder Create A File `deployment.yml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: node-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node-app
        image: programmingfire/node-app:1.0.0
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "128mi"
            cpu: "500m"
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8000
        imagePullPolicy: Always
```

### Create A Kubernetes Service

Inside Of `k8s` Folder Create A File `service.yml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: node-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: node-app
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 4000
    targetPort: 8000
```

### Apply Both Deployment And Service
```bash
# Apply Kubernetes Deployment
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yml

# Apply Kubernetes Service
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yml
```

Now After Some Time When All The Kubernetes Pods Are Created And Up And Running You Can Test Your Application On [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) Again

Just For Fun Let's Kill One Of The Pod In Kubernetes And See How Much Fast Is Kubernetes To Recover That

```bash
# List All The Pods
kubectl get pods

# Copy The ID Of Any Pod
kubectl delete pod <pod-id-here>
```

Now One Of 3 Pods Is Deleted

```bash
# List All The Pods Again
kubectl get pods 
```

All 3 Out Of 3 Pods Should Be Running Because Kubernetes ReCreated That Container When One Pod Get Deleted
